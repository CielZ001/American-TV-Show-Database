# American TV Show Database

This repository builds an American TV Show database for fans in China. SQL file was lost but you can see the data dictionary in [Design Document - American TV Show Community.docx] and build your own database.

This project covers from front end to back end, from database design to website design. Most codes were written in php and you can also see how data are extracted from the database using embodied sql codes in php. The website was designed in Chinese because it was originally created for Chinese American TV show fans.

For more information please read [Design Document - American TV Show Community.docx], which is the English (Directly translated by Google translate) version of 【设计说明文档】.


*SissiDance is my another account so this repository was originally created by me when I was chasing my bachelor's degree.
